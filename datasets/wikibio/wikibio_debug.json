[{"Context": "Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 \u2013 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895\u201396, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write \u2013 compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\".

Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990\u201391 series, his final Ashes appearance.

Caquatto suffered a knee injury shortly after, but managed to place 5th at the 2009 US National Championships. She was then invited to the World Championships Selection Camp and was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan.

Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and she had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva (n\u00e9e Bryant) Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with the headline: \"She's Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\". In 1944, Shively became a member of the Rockola Chicks team of the newly formed National Girls Baseball League. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year, she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season, she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78), hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45), and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers, her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches), and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated from Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana.

The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.\n\nIt was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.\n\nEarly in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the \"Gramotsava\" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as \"God's own country\".\n\nHe later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.\n\nAs Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).\n\nAs Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10.

His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.\n\nIn recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.", "Sentence": "He was born in 1886 in the village of Kanchrapara in Bengal.", "Label": "major inaccurate"}, {"Context": "Anthony Joseph Dimond (November 30, 1881 \u2013 May 28, 1953) was an American Democratic Party politician who was the Alaska Territory delegate in the United States House of Representatives for many years (1933\u20131945).

After that incident, he learned to live life to the fullest.\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement of the Huaorani, also known as Aucas, while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force; they attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. \"Life\" magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.\n\nIn 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio.

The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region. Adamu studied in Hausaland and earned the title \"Modibo\" (\"Lettered One\") for his scholarship.

Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. By the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll Decamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition. By age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after, Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that position until Mancini's death in 1994.

In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. Griffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm.\n\nThere was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the laws of cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958-59, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957-58 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959-60 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. He tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire. English umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over.\n\nAfter being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down. England quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6-62 and 5-34.\n\nA 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC President Gubby Allen. Griffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again.\n\nMany spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958-59 Ashes series toured England in 1961. He moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel.
